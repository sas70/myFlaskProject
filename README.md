Flask-RESTful requires Python version 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7

- Application Discovery Behavior

To run the application, use the flask command or python -m flask. Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable:

As a shortcut, if the file is named app.py or wsgi.py, you donâ€™t have to set the FLASK_APP environment variable. See Command Line Interface for more details.

$ export FLASK_APP=hello
$ flask run
